The USP of this oil is that, it uses only natural ingredients that also help in maintaining its natural health.By massaging with this oil, you may give them a very soothing and relaxing experience.A simple search for paw cream for their dog Aurum, led to Pratik & Nishita building the Papa Pawsome brand, prompted by the lack of availability of an effective and safe paw cream. That's how we started rolling the dice, our objective was very clear and simple i.e. to come up with a paw cream that was mild enough to not harm dogs. After extensive research and trial and error, the first prototype was born – a paw cream made of natural ingredients which showed great results with no side effects.The Indian market lacked a product of rivalling quality and effectiveness and that’s when we started putting the right checks in the right places that’s how the journey of Papa Pawsome began. We added Natural Shampoo, Aroma therapy massage oil, Waterless shampoo, Healing balms, Silicone free detangling serum, Spa gifts. We pledge to provide only the best for your pet and for you.

So far, nothing has worked to reduce hair fall and rid your scalp of flakes. But what you might not realize is that it could be the products you're using directly contributing to the damage.Harsh ingredients can dry out your skin and strip your hair follicles of their natural protective oils. If you can bring back nourishment and moisture, you can even nurture growth!Stress, styling, and harsh hair products can contribute to hair damage, thinning, and hair fall. Our nourishing shampoo-conditioner may help by resupplying your hair with the nutrients it needs to rebuild its structure.This product is rich in Vitamin C and antioxidants from Amla. Methi supplies fiber, iron, and protein. Bhringraj may also help by promoting scalp circulation, strengthening your roots, and promoting hair growth.It’s easy to be swayed by synthetic fragrances and products that promise completely fresh, new-looking hair overnight. But if you want real results that last, it’s time to fix your hair care routine from the roots.This shampoo-and-conditioner-in-one is infused with neem, geranium, and lavender oil, plus extracts from aloe vera, Brahmi, bhringraj, amla, methika, and licorice. Harness the power of nature for your hair!Excess oil doesn’t mean your scalp isn’t dry. Oil production is a sign your scalp needs major hydration.To help with dandruff control, our shampoo has methi (Fenugreek) extract which contains lecithin, a natural emollient that may help condition and moisturize your hair and scalp. It also has geranium oil that may help soothe an itchy scalp and protective nutrients from neem oil to keep irritants at bayConditioner is supposed to smooth down your hair cuticles after shampooing to restore softness and shine to the strands. That means it’s not working if your hair stays limp and flat or dry, brittle, and frizzy after every wash.You don't need to reach for a separate bottle of heavier conditioner–instead, this 2-in-1 product is loaded with natural oils and plant extracts that will help keep your hair as smooth as silk!Not all shampoos were made for regular use by all hair types. But if you need a product you can use for daily hair care, this natural cleanser boasts a mild formulation that won’t dry out the skin or your strands.Men, women, and kids can safely use it as a daily hair wash without worrying about stripping off oils or protective layers–helping hair stay fresh, clean, vibrant, and soft to the touch.",,7H," Refresh Your Hair & Scalp - Ditch harsh hair products.

During our first pregnancy in London, we got introduced to safe, natural, toxin tree products for ourselves and our first daughter, Myraah. When we were expecting Syna, our second daughter, we struggled to find similar products in India that we could trust. We ended up depending on trips abroad or visiting relatives from ‘foreign’ countries to stock up on products that were safe. It was neither feasible nor practical. After 2 years of the struggle and seeing many moms go through something similar, we decided to start The Moms Co. We were clear that our products would have to be something that we could use ourselves, confidently and fearlessly. We would like to welcome you to the family. With love and warmth, Malika and Mohit.At The Moms Co. our products are Made with Love and Without Compromise. We have brought in experts from across the world to help us create the safest natural formulations that are certified toxin free.

Most importantly, a cleanser that restores natural levels of oil and moisture through ample hydration.  , In addition to these, it is also a makeup remover. The thought of the long process of removing makeup properly should not stop any one from applying it and as working women we know what a saviour a good makeup remover is. Hence, we were certain that our cleanser should be able to easily, quickly and efficiently remove all traces of makeup at the end of a long day without making the skin dry and irritable.  , Made with Sodium hyaluronate - a molecule that is derived from Hyaluronic acid. These molecules are so small that they penetrate the uppermost layers of your skin easily, providing nourishment, hydration and therefore a strengthened skin barrier.  , It also includes Red Algae Extract (Crispus Chondrus Extract) - A naturally derived extract that is rich in polysaccharides, peptides and fatty acids. It is one of the most incredible antioxidants with equally great cleansing and hydrating properties.  , This dual-acting cleanser is designed to work as a make-up remover as well! This hydrating formula can cleanse your skin deeply and purify it, without stripping it of its natural oils, leaving you with naturally glowing skin!  , How To Use: Massage a dollop on to dry or damp skin and rinse to remove makeup. Then, take some more and lather it up with water, massage into skin and rinse again to cleanse thoroughly.  , Ingredients: Sodium Hyaluronate, Red Algae Extract, Vitamin B5 Aqua, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Decyl Glucoside, Acrylates copolymer, Sodium Cocyl Isethionate, PEG - 7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Coco glucoside, Ethylene Glycol distearate , Glycerin, Coco-Glucoside , Glyceryl Oleate, Olive oil PEG 7 ester, Phenoxyethanol (and) Ethylhexylglycerin (and) Octenidine HCl, 1,3 Propanediol, Triethanolamine, Sodium PCA, Panthenol,Sodium Hyaluronate, L-Proline, Hydroxyproline, Chondrus crispus extract, citric acid  , Key Highlights: This product is Vegan, Dermatologically Tested, Cruelty Free, Sulphate Free, Paraben Free, pH 6-6.5  ",,India,19 June 2022,,,15%,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41KDp0yA5QL.jpg,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91PbP2DsmpL.jpg,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41wXstcIhnL.jpg,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/416dgnfQWKL.jpg,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41un1fLZgWL.jpg,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/418xWHFytkL.jpg,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41UvNPsWBHL.jpg",Store in a Cool and Dry Place,,,,,,,,,,100.0 millilitre,,,295,"Beauty,Skin Care,Face,Cleansing Creams & Milks,Face Wash",4.4,161 global ratings,10% Instant Discount up to INR 500 on IDBI Bank Card Trxns.
